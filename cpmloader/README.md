This is the QT App that lets you upload the CP/M kernel (CPM3.SYS) to your Z80 computer via the Arduino Mega. It also serves as serial "Fileserver". I recommend to use Qt Creator 4.12.4 along with QT 5.15.0/MinGW 8.1.0 64-bit and CMake 3.17.1 to build the executable. I developed and tested all under Windows 10, but it might also work on other platforms that are supported by QT. I have never tested this, so I cannot tell whether it works. It does not matter where the cpmloader.exe is located, but it will ask for the location of the CP/M root directory when you click the "load CP/M" button for the first time. The Root directory must contain the CPM3.SYS file and the folder that contains the CP/M programs.
