You can add a category using a new category number, which must
be three digits long, between 001 and 999.  You need to have a
name for the category, which can be 27 letters long.  It is a
good idea to have a name that isn't confusing with other names
you might have for categories.  You will also need some
"attributes".  If you remember that the first letter of the
attributes must be either "I" or "E" (for income or expense),
you will get by, but check the manual for complete details.
You can change an existing category name or attributes.  If
you haven't used a category yet this year, you can even delete
a category.
