If you want to physically write a check and then deliver it or
mail it, or have already done so, enter "CHECK".  You may also
enter "CHECK" if you made a withdrawal or transfer of funds
using an automatic teller machine at the bank or elsewhere.
MONEY MAESTRO will record that you wrote the check, and deduct
the amount from your checking account balance.  If you paid for
something with a Master Card, VISA card, or cash, then enter
"MC", "VISA", or "CASH", respectively.  None of these will
affect your checking account balance, but will keep records for
budget and tax purposes.  Likewise, "MEMO" can be used to make
notes for budget or tax purposes.  Any of the above can be
abbreviated, since only the first few characters of the reply
are inspected.  Abbreviations recognized are MC, ME, CH, CA,
and V.
