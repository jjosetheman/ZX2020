                    Welcome to Money Maestro!

     The Money Maestro home banking system is intended to
relieve you of the troublesome details of financial
record keeping and to provide you with the information you need
to manage your money well.  This system is designed to be used
entirely without documentation and you will easily learn to run
it.  Simply follow the directions as they appear on the screen.
Most prompts will be very clear but, if you get stuck, type ?
and you will usually get further instructions.  If you want to
stop what you are doing, type the ESC key (or ESCAPE on some
keyboards), and MONEY MAESTRO will attempt to gracefully back
you out of whatever situation you are in.

     Remember, all of your answers should be followed by
pressing the RETURN (or ENTER) key to let the machine know you
have stopped typing.  If you would like to run the system on
the sample data we have included, stop the system (by typing
END) and restart it by typing MAESTRO PRACTICE rather than just
MAESTRO.  If all else fails, the manual includes a practice run
based on this data as well as notes on some of the more
sophisticated uses of the system.

     Basic input to the system consists of all the financial
transactions you make.  This would include all the transactions
normally recorded in your checkbook (deposits, checks written,
charges incurred, etc.), as well as transactions made in cash
or by charge card.  These are entered through menu choice 1.
You will want to record this income and expense by category
for later reporting.  We have included a typical category list,
but don't feel constrained by it.  If you don't use a
category - delete it.  If you have income or make payments that
don't fit - make a new category.  Since you may reference the
categories by name, the numbers are not too important.

     When entering checks you will also be asked for a PAYEE
name.  Here, you may just enter the name of the company or
person you want to pay, or from whom you are receiving money.
However, if you think you may later wish to get histories of
payments to that payee, you will want to enter the name on the
payee list.  This will also save you the trouble of typing the
whole name every time.  Add to or amend the payee list through
menu choice 10.

     While paying bills or making deposits, you will also be
asked to record a memorandum of the transaction.  This is just
a space (25 letters or numbers long) to help you remember what
you were paying for.  Some people use the invoice numbers of
their bills, some write things like "June phone bill".  This
space is for your convenience, use it as you like.  You may
also show payments and deposits that have not directly affected
your account balance.  These will be payments made by
MasterCard, Visa, or Cash.  Probably the best way to get to
know the system is to run it.  Don't worry about budgeting, tax
reporting, and stockpiles just yet, you will get plenty of use
from the system without them.
