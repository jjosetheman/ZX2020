Use ADD if you want to add a new payee to your list of payees.
You will need to know your account number, the name of the
payee, your name as the payee knows you, and some idea of what
kinds of things you buy.  Use CHANGE if you want to change the
name of the payee (maybe you misspelled it or they merged with
another company), or your account number, what they use for
your name, or what you usually buy from them.  Use DELETE if
you want to remove a payee from your payee list.  It is not
necessary that all your payees stay in the list until the end
of the year, so feel free to delete any you don't think you
will use any more.  When you are finished making all your
changes, just enter END, and the new list will be written back
out and be saved on disk.  If you hit ESCape instead of END,
all your changes will be thrown away and the old list will
be used again.
